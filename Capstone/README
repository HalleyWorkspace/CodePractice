#CAPSTONE
This was my capstone project for Western Govenors Univercity. The majority of the project was done as part of my "Software 2" class but there are some changes and additional features in the code.
The bulk of this project was in the paperwork of the two included .docx files. I also included the sql files to set up the database and create an initial test user for the program.
