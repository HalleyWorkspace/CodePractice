# Software 1
This was created as part of my Software 1 class at Western Govenors Univercity.
This is an extreamly simple program for a mock company to track parts in a warehouse and available for sale.
It does not make use of any database or other way to save information between sessions and is instead initialized to default state every time it is run.
